            TAMPA, Fla. -- After struggling in the first half, quarterback Lamar
            Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens were able to put things together
            offensively, even after losing tight end Mark Andrews to a shoulder
            injury in the second quarter, to knock off Tom Brady and the Tampa
            Bay Buccaneers, 27-22.
